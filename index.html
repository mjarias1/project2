      <p>Welcome! This website includes my resume and another page about video games.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I commute at Illinois Institute of Technology, majoring in Information Technology Management. I decided to study ITM because I've always been interested in technology and how it connects with real-world problems.
      Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games and working on car audios. I also spend a lot of time with my friends from high school. We like to play basketball pickup games, go camping, and visit one of my friends college outside of Chicago.</p>
